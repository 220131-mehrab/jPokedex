This program will start out as the Java version of the week 1 Pokedex we worked on in class. 

After it is built, the plan is to make the menu system more responsive, make the menu system multilayered (sub menus), and split
the results among two columns, and create a paging system for the results. 

Once a result is chosen, then the Pokedex entry will be displayed onscreen.

Check the CHANGELOG.md for more information. I am keeping a standup that will be available on my portfolio once the program is completed a bit more.
