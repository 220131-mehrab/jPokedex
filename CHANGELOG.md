Day 1 - 2-7-22
==============

- Planned the program's look and feel
- Planned the program's verbiage for the initial screen
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 2 - 2-8-22
==============

- Added color unicode value variables
- Made menu text
- Updated README.md with website particulars. More thorough standup (changelog) will be
  uploaded to my portfolio once I am at a certain point in the program.

Day 3 - 2-9-22
==============

- Finding documentation to accept input appears fruitless.
- Choosing my battle to be lost for the time being.
- I did lose a day, but I did find information on how to make a windows program in Java.
- I will build a basic argument-driven command line Java program, and then work on the
  Windows version.
